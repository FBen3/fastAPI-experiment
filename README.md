## FastAPI experiment

> FastAPI (sits between Flask and Django when it comes to APIs; more general purpose, as opposed to exclusive web-app; built-in async support for high-throughput data streams)

Playing with the FastAPI framework...

- `main` branch has the FastAPI implementation
- `bare` branch has a "bare" API implemented without any frameworks
